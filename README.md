Study material and lesson plans for incoming TIY students

This is the course material given to students to complete the Iron Yard's Front End Fundamentals course.

As an associate instructor it is my job to complete these ahead of time in order to have a better understanding 
of the material being presented and to be able to answer any questions students may have about these assignments.
